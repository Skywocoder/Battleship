                GAME PREPARATION
                <br>
                <br>
                Battleship is played with two players.<br>
                
                Now each player draws a total of ten ships on the playing field: <br> <br>
                
                1x Battleship with 5 boxes <br>
                2x Kreuzer with 4 squares each<br>
                3x Destroyer with 3 boxes each<br>
                4x submarine with 2 boxes each<br> <br> <br>

                GAMEPLAY<br><br>
                Player 1 gives a coordinate to fire at.
                
                The coordinate consists of a row and a column, for example "D5". <br>Player 1 marks this coordinate on the "Enemy Ships" board to keep track of things.<br>
                
                Player 2 now checks whether one of his ships was hit. He then replies "Water" (if no ship was hit), "Hit" or "Sunk" <br> (if all of the ship's boxes are hit). 
                Players also mark the coordinates in the "Own Ships" field to track if and when their ships are sunk.<br>
                
                If player 1 has hit or even sunk a ship of player 2, he may fire again. If player 1 has hit the water, it is now player 2's turn.
                
                According to these rules, the game is now played alternately. The player who sinks all of the enemy ships first is the winner.</p>
